smartGolf project - An OpenSource golf tracker using RFID tag and smartphone


The idea is to devellop an OpenSource Golf tracker logging each Golf stroke during the play using the RFID tag on club/Smart Phone (with RFID ability).

The whole software is made using Meteor.Js/Cordova.

The system include:
-One server
-2 clients:
    -Web browser: To display games played, Statistic, Social functionnality
    -Mobile App (Android): To log each strok during the game and send them to the server.
    
The functionnality will be:
-Possibility to display your own and friends game on a map using Google map API.
-Get intensive statistics about your own game.
-Voice Caddy during the game.
